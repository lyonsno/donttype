"""Optical lifecycle adapter for the operator overlay.

This module extracts lifecycle decision law from CommandOverlay internals into
a testable adapter. The adapter owns:

  - lifecycle state and event vocabulary
  - retarget-progress decision: when summon arrives during dismiss, what
    progress to re-enter at
  - pending-entrance teardown decision: whether an alpha-zero entrance can
    be torn down without playing dismiss
  - text-plane restore contract shape

It does NOT own:
  - Metal/compositor rendering, SDF fill, or visual tuning
  - AppKit timer management
  - any mutable CommandOverlay state
