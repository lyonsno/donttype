# Optical Field Contract

`spoke.optical_field` is the primitive-owned boundary for compositor-space optical
field requests. Consumers provide identity, desired bounds, lifecycle state,
freshness, provisional/final status, profile intent, and disturbances as data.
The primitive owns geometry continuity and transition custody.

## Retargetable Geometry Mailbox

Each `caller_id` has one latest accepted target. The mailbox is not FIFO:
newer valid same-caller geometry replaces older unplayed geometry unless a
future request explicitly declares choreographed sequencing. Current requests
support these lifecycle states:

- `materialize`
- `rest`
- `resize`
- `recenter`
- `dismiss`
- `hidden`

The backend keeps primitive-owned transition state for each caller:

- `previous_bounds`: the bounds a new transition starts from
- `presented_bounds`: the latest sampled visual bounds currently on screen
- `target_bounds`: the latest accepted desired bounds
- `target_request`: the latest accepted request data
- `pending_request`: always `None` in the default coalescing mailbox

When an in-flight transition is interrupted, the primitive retargets from the
latest sampled `presented_bounds`, not from stale requested `from_bounds`.
Consumers may report sampled visual bounds through
`sample_presented_bounds(caller_id, bounds)` or pass `presented_bounds` while
upserting the next request.

## Freshness

Requests may carry:

- `display_epoch`: coordinate-space or display-capture freshness
- `source_epoch`: semantic/capture/source freshness when applicable
- `provisional`: whether this is an optimizer/intermediate target

For a single caller, requests with older `display_epoch` or `source_epoch` than
the latest accepted request are rejected and do not alter the current target.
Final targets can interrupt provisional targets at the same epoch. A provisional
target cannot overwrite a final target unless it carries a newer freshness
epoch.

## Motion Strategy

Consumers may attach `OpticalFieldMotionIntent` to a request, but that intent is
finite data. House owns the final continuity decision and the execution curve.

Supported motion strategies:

- `auto`
- `continuous`
- `morph`
- `squirt`
- `dematerialize_rematerialize`
- `snap`

`auto` resolves by comparing the current presented bounds to the desired target
bounds. The metric is:

```python
intersection_area(current, target) / min(current_area, target_area)
```

The default overlap threshold is `0.50`. Ratios greater than the threshold
preserve the same optical presence and use the profile-selected same-presence
strategy, currently `squirt`. Ratios less than or equal to the threshold resolve
to `dematerialize_rematerialize`. `continuity="new_presence"` or
`continuity="replace"` also resolves to `dematerialize_rematerialize`, even when
the rectangles overlap.

When a mailbox transition is present, `auto` uses `presented_bounds` as the
current geometry. This is the interruption contract: a final semantic target can
interrupt provisional motion and retarget from the sampled visual state instead
of replaying stale provisional rectangles. Obsolete provisional requests remain
non-FIFO mailbox input and cannot overwrite an equal-epoch final target.

## Dismiss And Hidden

`dismiss` and `hidden` are latest desired states for the same caller, not side
queues. Accepting either one clears any pending materialize, resize, or recenter
intent by replacing the caller's target. `hidden` requests do not compile to a
visible shell config.

## Compositor Payload

Compiled placeholder shell configs preserve the existing `optical_field`
metadata. When a request carries freshness or active geometry custody, the
metadata also includes a `transition` block:

```python
{
    "from_bounds": (x, y, width, height),
    "presented_bounds": (x, y, width, height),
    "target_bounds": (x, y, width, height),
    "display_epoch": 3,
    "source_epoch": 9,
    "provisional": False,
}
```

Requests with a motion intent also include a `motion` block:

```python
{
    "requested_strategy": "auto",
    "resolved_strategy": "squirt",
    "continuity": "preserve_identity",
    "overlap_ratio": 0.76,
    "overlap_threshold": 0.50,
    "same_presence": True,
    "reason": "overlap_above_threshold",
}
```

This payload is compositor-owned state. Consumers must not reconstruct previous
visual bounds, install private geometry queues, or drive warp/fill phases to
compensate for frequent geometry updates.
